        <p>From the chart it is noticeable that streaming music is starting to become popular around this time. Another noticeable trend is that
            ringtone sales are at an all time low since it began to sale. This data show evidence on how music is bought and used during the year 2012,
            and begins to change throughout the next couple of years. What could of caused this change in music interest? Could it be that music was
            seen as being cheaper streaming downloading than buying a ringtone, or that streaming was a better way to gain music for half the cost?</p>
